## Prebuilt Images

Size is approximately 4 GB _(too chubby, I know â€” see the [To-Do](#to-do) section)._

Images are available in the following repositories:
- Docker Hub: [`docker.io/erhhung/al2023-devops`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/erhhung/al2023-devops)
- GitHub Container Registry: [`ghcr.io/erhhung/al2023-devops`](https://github.com/erhhung/al2023-devops/pkgs/container/al2023-devops)

Version information about the installed components can be found inside the Docker image at `/root/.versions.json`.

## To-Do

The current "All-in-One" image is getting too bloated, so there's a need to create specialized versions, like a slimmed-down image just for CI/CD pipelines, and a separate image for launching ad-hoc containers for manual administration and debugging. It's also unlikely that a single CI/CD pipeline stage would need all language environments, as Python and Go are especially chubby.
